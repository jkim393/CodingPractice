1. unordered set
#include<unordered_set>
unordered_set<int> hashTable;
if(hashTable.find(value) == hashTable.end() ) //not found
.insert()

2. list
iter = l.erase(position) // returns the next position
l.remove(value) // removes all elements of that value

3. delete pointer
good practice:
1. delete ptr  //frees the data that ptr points
2. ptr = nullptr //make sure ptr is not pointing to random value

4. delete struct
set the ptr of the struct to null first
delete the struct

5. smart pointer

6. max
*max_element(a.begin(), a.end());
